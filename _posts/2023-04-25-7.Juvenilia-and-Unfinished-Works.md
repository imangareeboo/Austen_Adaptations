categories: literature
---

What is meant by "Unpublished Works"? For the purposes of this post, and for ease of cataloguing, "unpublished works" will cover Austen's Juvenilia, her completed but unpublished story *Lady Susan*, and the incomplete works entitled *The Watsons* and *Sanditon*. 

## Juvenilia

Austen's Juvenilia are considered to be the works written in her young adulthood, before her novels, as well as the works she created for sharing with her family. 

Some of the stories in Austen's juvenilia are included in the 1999 film adaptation (of the same name) of *Mansfield Park*.

### *The History of England - By a partial, prejudiced, and ignorant author*

Although we aren't aware of a standalone adaptation of this in text, film, or stage, this particular work is referenced in the 1999 film adaptation of *Mansfield Park*.


## *Lady Susan*

Whit Stillman's 2016 *Love and Friendship* is both a film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MaSK3POHI0" target="_blank">(Trailer)</a> and a <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/love-friendship-whit-stillman/1123252664?ean=9780316294157" target="_blank">book</a>, both written by him.

**It should be noted** that Whit Stillman's *Love and Friendship* is an adaptation of Austen's *Lady Susan*, not the Austen juvenilia short story entitled *Love and Friendship*.
